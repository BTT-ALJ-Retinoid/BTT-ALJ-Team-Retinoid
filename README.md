# Equitable AI for Dermatology 

This repository contains our submission for Break Through Tech AI x Algorithim Justice League (AJL) Kaggle competition. As fellows from the Break Through Tech AI Program, we’re building an inclusive machine learning model to classify 21 dermatological conditions across diverse skin tones. The ultimate goal of this project is to center fairness, transparency, and equity within healthcare.

# Project Overview

This challenge is part of the Break Through Tech AI Program, which empowers undergraduate women and non-binary students through hands-on experience in real-world AI applications. In collaboration with the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL), the goal of this competition is to address systemic bias in dermatology AI tools—particularly their underperformance on darker skin tones.

# Objectives

- Build a multiclass image classifier for 21 skin conditions

- Ensure fairness across skin tones using AI explainability and bias detection tools

- Document the full journey with visualizations and narratives that center marginalized perspectives

# Goals
- Achieve strong classification performance on the leaderboard (weighted F1 score)

- Deliver a transparent and fair model with visualizations and insights

- Contribute to the AI fairness movement in healthcare by centering marginalized voices

# Evaluation
Models are evaluated using the weighted average F1 score, accounting for class imbalances in the dataset.

# Tools & Frameworks - update after submission
- Python, PyTorch / TensorFlow

- scikit-learn

- OpenCV
